# NN-from-scratch

A neural network (NN) built entirely from scratch in Python, with no reliance on external deep learning libraries. This project emphasizes a ground-up implementation of core neural network concepts, including a custom autograd engine and a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for binary classification tasks.

## Features
- **From-scratch autograd**: Scalar-based automatic differentiation engine (`Value` class)
- **Hand-built neural network modules**: Neuron, Layer, and MLP classes coded without frameworks
- **Manual training loop**: Stochastic gradient descent with hinge loss and L2 regularization
- **No external deep learning libraries**: All neural network logic and backpropagation are implemented natively in Python
